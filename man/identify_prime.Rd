\title{Identify Player Prime Years}
\usage{
identify_prime(
  data,
  method = c("predicted", "actual"),
  threshold_pct = 70,
  games_pct_threshold = 40,
  min_seasons = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing player performance data.
For method="predicted": Must include columns 'id', 'age', 'predicted_value', 'games_played', 'league'
For method="actual": Must include columns 'id', 'age', 'player_value', 'games_played', 'league', 'season'}

\item{method}{Character string. The method to use for identifying prime years.
Options are "predicted" (using player trajectory predictions) or
"actual" (using actual season data). Default is "predicted".}

\item{threshold_pct}{Numeric. The percentage of peak performance to consider as prime years.
Default is 70.}

\item{games_pct_threshold}{Numeric. The percentile threshold for games played to consider
in prime calculations. Default is 40.}

\item{min_seasons}{Integer. For method="actual", the minimum number of seasons required
to calculate a prime. Default is 5.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing prime years information for each player:
\item{id}{Player identifier}
\item{league}{Player's league}
\item{max_value_age}{Age at peak performance}
\item{start_age}{Age when prime years begin}
\item{end_age}{Age when prime years end}
\item{prime_duration}{Duration of prime in years}
\item{threshold_value}{The performance threshold used}
\item{threshold_pct}{The percentage threshold specified}
\item{skip_before_used}{Whether a skip was used before peak due to low games played}
\item{skip_after_used}{Whether a skip was used after peak due to low games played}
}
\description{
Identifies the prime years in a player's career based on performance data.
This function can work with either predicted trajectory data (from spline models)
or actual player season data, determining prime years as a period where performance
remains above a specified threshold of peak performance.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# With predicted trajectory data
player_trajectories <- readr::read_csv("player_spline_predictions.csv")
player_joins <- player_trajectories |>
  dplyr::left_join(sports |> dplyr::select(id, league, position, age, games_played), by = c("id", "age"))
player_prime_pct <- identify_prime(player_joins, method = "predicted", threshold_pct = 80)

# With actual player data
sports <- build_all_sports(nfl_value = fpts.game)
player_prime_actual <- identify_prime(sports, method = "actual", threshold_pct = 80, min_seasons = 5)
}
