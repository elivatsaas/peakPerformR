"chess", "mlb", "mls", "nba", "nhl", "nwsl", "pwhl", "wnba", "nfl".
Use "all" to save all available datasets.}

\item{data_dir}{Character string. Directory where the rebuilt CSV files are located.

\description{
After rebuilding data using any of the build_* functions, this function
properly saves the generated CSV files within the package structure.
This ensures that the rebuilt data is available for future use without
needing to rebuild from APIs again.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# First rebuild data
build_nba(use_cached = FALSE)
build_mlb(use_cached = FALSE)
build_nfl(use_cached = FALSE)

# Then save the rebuilt data
save_rebuilt_data(leagues = c("nba", "mlb", "nfl"))

# Save all available rebuilt data
save_rebuilt_data(leagues = "all")
}

}
