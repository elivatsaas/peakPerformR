  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{output_path}{Character string. Optional path to save output CSV file.}

\item{use_cached}{Logical. Whether to use cached data (TRUE) or rebuild from APIs (FALSE).}

\item{start_year}{Integer. First year to fetch data for when rebuilding. Default is 2016.}

\item{end_year}{Integer. Last year to fetch data for when rebuilding. Default is current year.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to internal functions.}

\description{
Builds a dataset of NWSL (National Women's Soccer League) players with performance data from
the American Soccer Analysis API. By default, uses pre-packaged data included
with the package. When use_cached=FALSE, fetches and processes data from APIs.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get pre-packaged data
nwsl_data <- build_nwsl()

# Rebuild data from APIs (takes time)
nwsl_data_fresh <- build_nwsl(use_cached = FALSE)

# Get data for specific years
nwsl_data_recent <- build_nwsl(use_cached = FALSE, start_year = 2020, end_year = 2023)

# Save to specific location
build_nwsl(output_path = "path/to/save/directory")
}
