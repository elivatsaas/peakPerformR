)
}
\arguments{
\item{output_path}{Character string. Optional path to save output CSV file.}

\item{use_cached}{Logical. Whether to use cached data (TRUE) or rebuild from APIs (FALSE).}

\item{seasons}{Integer vector. Seasons to pull data for. Default is 2016:2024.}

\item{scrape_birthdays}{Logical. Whether to scrape player birthdays from EliteProspects

\description{
Builds a dataset of PWHL (Professional Women's Hockey League) players with performance data from
the fastRhockey package. By default, uses pre-packaged data included with the package.
When use_cached=FALSE, fetches and processes data from APIs.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get pre-packaged data
pwhl_data <- build_pwhl()

# Rebuild data from APIs (takes time)
pwhl_data_fresh <- build_pwhl(use_cached = FALSE)

# Rebuild data for specific seasons
pwhl_data_recent <- build_pwhl(use_cached = FALSE, seasons = 2020:2024)

# Rebuild data and scrape missing birthdays
pwhl_data_complete <- build_pwhl(use_cached = FALSE, scrape_birthdays = TRUE)

# Save to specific location
build_pwhl(output_path = "path/to/save/directory")
}
