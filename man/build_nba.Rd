\title{Build NBA Player Data}
\usage{
build_nba(output_path = NULL, use_cached = TRUE, seasons = 2002:2024, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{output_path}{Character string. Optional path to save output CSV file.}

\item{use_cached}{Logical. Whether to use cached data (TRUE) or rebuild from APIs (FALSE).}

\item{seasons}{Integer vector. Seasons to pull data for. Default is 2002:2024.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to internal functions.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing NBA player data if output_path is NULL.
Otherwise, writes to the specified path and returns that path invisibly.
}
\description{
Builds a dataset of NBA players with performance data from the hoopR package.
By default, uses pre-packaged data included with the package. When use_cached=FALSE,
fetches and processes data from APIs, which may take significant time.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get pre-packaged data
nba_data <- build_nba()

# Rebuild data from APIs (takes time)
nba_data_fresh <- build_nba(use_cached = FALSE)

# Rebuild for specific seasons
nba_data_recent <- build_nba(use_cached = FALSE, seasons = 2020:2023)

# Save to specific location
build_nba(output_path = "path/to/save/directory")
}
