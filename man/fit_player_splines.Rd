\title{Fit a Smoothing Spline to Player Performance Data}
\usage{
fit_player_splines(player_data, min_knots = 3, max_knots = 8, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{player_data}{A data frame containing player performance data.
Must include 'age', 'player_value', and 'player_name' columns.}

\item{min_knots}{Minimum number of knots for the spline fit. Default is 3.}

\item{max_knots}{Maximum number of knots for the spline fit. Default is 8.}

\item{verbose}{TRUE/FALSE. whether you want to print errors and messages. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{model}{The fitted smooth.spline object}
\item{knots}{The number of knots used in the model}
\item{method}{The fitting method that was used}
\item{fit_success}{Logical indicating if fitting was successful}
If fitting fails completely, returns NULL.
}
\description{
Creates a smoothing spline model for a player's performance over their career,
using age as the predictor and player_value as the response variable.
This function implements multiple fitting approaches to ensure robust results,
with explicit smoothing parameter control for better handling of sharp peaks.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get data for a specific player
player_data <- all_sports_tidy \%>\% filter(id == "NBA-lebron-james-00")

# Fit the spline model
spline_fit <- fit_player_splines(player_data)

# Plot the result
plot(player_data$age, player_data$player_value)
lines(spline_fit$model, col = "red")
}
